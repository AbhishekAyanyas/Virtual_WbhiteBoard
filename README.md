# Virtual_WbhiteBoard
A gesture-based digital whiteboard that lets users draw, write, and interact using only hand movements â€” perfect for teaching, brainstorming, and presentations without touching the screen.
# To run the Virtual Whiteboard project, make sure the environment is set up correctly. First, install Python and Django. Then, install the required libraries:
numpy
opencv-python
# Use the following commands in the terminal or command prompt:
cd virtual white board.py
cd vbproject
python manage.py runserver
# This will start the Django project and launch the Virtual Whiteboard system.
